# Workflows
Colaborate here. Two ways to do this:

1. To edit in native Word or InDesign applications, create a new branch, then download and edit the "raw" file. When you're ready to upload your changes, add the new file (use same file name) and then generate a "pull" request to merge your changes to the "main" branch. To collaborate on the document before you upload it, use the "Issues" tab to create discussions and tag collaborators. 

2. To edit manuscripts or RTF files BEFORE they go into design, create a new branch, then simply click the text files. Any changes you make in this document are easily comparable to previous versions, and generating a pull requests will highlight any changes and provide an opportunity for your collaborators to view changes before merging the file back into the master branch. For collaboration outside of editing the file, use the "Issues" tab above to comment and tag collaborators.
